<h2>A First Look at Writing Queries</h2>
<p>
    Data in SEDE is organized in several tables&ndash;posts (questions and answers are together in one table), users,
    badges, comments, and so on. There are a lot of tables; you can see the list in the Query Composer:
</p>

<p>
    Some of these tables are specialized; you can come back to them later. As a newcomer to SEDE you are probably most
    interested in the first two tables, <strong>Posts</strong> and <strong>Users</strong>. Let's look at <strong>Posts</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    To view data from a table in SEDE, you write a SQL <code class="cm-s-default"><span class="cm-sql-keyword">SELECT</span></code>
    statement. (You can type your SQL right into the Query Composer window.) As the name implies, a
    <code class="cm-s-default"><span class="cm-sql-keyword">SELECT</span></code> statement picks out the specific
    information that you're looking for. But what if you just want to browse, to get a feel for what kind of data is
    in a table? Try this:
</p>
<pre class="cm-s-default"><span class="cm-sql-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="cm-sql-keyword">TOP</span> <span class="cm-sql-number">100</span> <span class="cm-sql-operator">*</span> <span class="cm-sql-keyword">FROM</span> <span class="cm-sql-word">Posts</span></pre>
<a class="run-prompt" href="//data.stackexchange.com/meta.stackexchange/query/230846/explore-posts-tutorial"><i class="icon-terminal"></i>&nbsp;Run Query</a>
<p>
    This query returns all the columns for the first 100 posts (questions and answers). This shows you what columns are in
    the data and what their values look like. Let's take a look at some results from this query:
</p>
<img src="~/Content/images/tutorial/select-100-posts-output.png" alt="output from previous query" class="screenshot">
<p>
    Notice that one of the columns is <strong>PostTypeId</strong>, and its value (in these results) is always either 1 or 2.
    Looking at the data, we might observe that only posts with a type of 1 have values for <strong>AcceptedAnswerId</strong>
    and <strong>ViewCount</strong>, and might (correctly) conclude that a post type of 1 means the post is a question. By
    extension, then, a value of 2 would probably mean an answer (with <strong>ParentId</strong> pointing to the question).
</p>
<p>
    That's correct in this case, but reasoning from the data like this is risky. In SEDE there are two kinds of numeric
    values you might see&ndash;"real numbers", like view count or score, and numbers like post types which represent
    categories or types. If you see a number that looks like the latter, look for an explicit list of the values instead
    of guessing. In this case the column heading is "PostTypeId" and the table list has a PostTypes table. That table
    shows two columns, a number and a name:
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, the <strong>Posts</strong> table itself doesn't tell you that; it just records the data type:
</p>
<img src="~/Content/images/tutorial/composer-table-posts.png" alt="entry for Posts table" class="screenshot">
<p>
    In SEDE, a type of <code class="cm-s-default"><span class="cm-variable-2">tinyint</span></code> usually means there is
    another table that has values that explain what this number means. If you see something listed as a
    <code class="cm-s-default"><span class="cm-variable-2">tinyint</span></code>, look for a table listing the values. The
    table's name matches up with the name of the column using it&ndash;"PostTypeId" and "PostTypes", in this case.
</p>
<p>
    So what are the values? Click on the <i class="icon-info"></i>&nbsp;(information) icon next to the table name:
</p>
<img src="~/Content/images/tutorial/composer-table-post-types-2.png" alt="entry for PostTypes table with info link circled" class="screenshot">
<p>
    Clicking on that reveals the values defined for this table:
</p>
<img src="~/Content/images/tutorial/post-types.png" alt="list of post types from schema" class="screenshot">
<p>
    (Click the <i class="icon-remove"></i>&nbsp;to return to the main list.)
</p>
<p>
    You'll notice that not all tables in the composer have the <i class="icon-info"></i>&nbsp;icon. This is specifically for
    tables with these special (enumerated) values, which always have the data type of <code class="cm-s-default"><span class="cm-variable-2">tinyint</span></code>.
    There are lots of other number values (of type <code class="cm-s-default"><span class="cm-variable-2">int</span></code>,
    for integer) running around in the data, like scores and view counts and user numbers; there's nothing to show there.
    But if there is something to show, you'll see the <i class="icon-info"></i>.
</p>
<p>
    Ok, back to writing queries. So far we've just sampled the data&ndash;we selected everything in the first few rows so
    we could browse. That's handy if you need to familiarize yourself with the data, but it's not how real queries are written.
